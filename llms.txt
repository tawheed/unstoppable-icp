## Key Facts
- Author: TK Kader (SVP Strategy at Marketo, Founder of ToutApp acquired by Marketo)
- Topic: Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) Framework
- Audience: B2B SaaS and AI Founders
- Key Stat: Companies with a defined ICP have 68% higher win rates
- URL: https://www.idealcustomerprofile.com

## Core Framework (3 Parts)
1. Firmographics - Revenue, headcount, geography, tech stack (the "who")
2. Triggers - Events that signal urgency like funding, hiring, regulatory changes (the "when")
3. Macro Trends - Market shifts creating "why now" narrative (the "why now")

## Key Concepts
- ICP vs Buyer Persona: ICP defines the target company, Buyer Persona defines the people within that company
- 10x Rule: Be 10x better in a small segment rather than marginally better in a large market
- Beachhead Market: A small, defensible segment to dominate before expanding
- TAM vs ICP: TAM is everyone you could sell to, ICP is who you should sell to right now

## Case Studies
- Lavu: Grew from $10M to $40M+ ARR by refining their ICP to a specific restaurant segment
- BoodleBox: Went from $0 to $1M ARR in 12 months by focusing on Higher Education
