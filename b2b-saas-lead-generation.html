            <p class="font-sans text-lg text-slate-700 leading-loose mb-8">
                <strong>B2B SaaS lead generation is the process of identifying and attracting potential business customers for your software product.</strong> But here's what most founders get wrong: they focus on tactics before strategy. They chase every new channel, every growth hack, every "secret" technique—while ignoring the fundamentals.
            </p>

            <p class="font-sans text-lg text-slate-700 leading-loose mb-8">
                The goal of marketing is simple: <strong>more people should know about you today than yesterday.</strong> That's it. Lead generation is about building awareness with the right people—not just anyone, but the prospects who match your Ideal Customer Profile and are ready to buy.

                    <strong>Lead generation without ICP is just noise generation.</strong> Before you choose channels or tactics, you need to know exactly who you're targeting. Your <a href="/" class="text-red-400 hover:text-red-300 underline">Ideal Customer Profile</a> is the foundation—it tells you where to fish, what bait to use, and who to ignore. Without it, you're throwing resources at the wall hoping something sticks.

            <p class="font-sans text-lg text-slate-700 leading-loose mb-8">
                Forget the shiny objects. These three channels are <strong>mostly free, compound over time, and work even better together.</strong> They've generated billions of dollars in pipeline for B2B SaaS companies.
            </p>

            <!-- Channel 1: LinkedIn -->

                <p class="font-sans text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    <strong>Business buyers are on LinkedIn.</strong> Not Twitter (for most B2B), not Facebook, not TikTok. LinkedIn is where your ICP prospects spend their professional time—and unlike Facebook, LinkedIn still provides organic reach.

                    <strong>B2B buyers need to know you, trust you, then buy from you.</strong> Webinars build the "trust" piece. They let you demonstrate expertise for 45-60 minutes—far more impactful than a blog post or ad.

                        Don't do product demos as webinars. Instead, share your <strong>manifesto</strong>—your unique point of view about the problem you solve. Talk about "the thing about the thing." This builds trust and positions you as a thought leader, not just another vendor.

                The 3 channels we covered—LinkedIn, Webinars, and Outbound—are your lead generation <em>tactics</em>. But tactics without strategy is just noise. <strong>To make lead generation actually work, it must be part of a complete Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy.</strong>
            </p>

            <p class="font-sans text-lg text-slate-700 leading-loose mb-8">
                Here's how it all fits together: Lead generation is Step 6 (Execution) of a 6-step GTM framework. If you skip Steps 1-5, your lead generation will underperform—you'll target the wrong people, with the wrong message, at the wrong time. Let's break down the full picture.
