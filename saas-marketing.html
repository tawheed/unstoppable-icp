                <strong>SaaS Marketing is the strategic process of attracting, converting, and retaining customers for a software-as-a-service product.</strong> Unlike traditional marketing, SaaS marketing must account for recurring revenue models, longer sales cycles, and the need to prove ongoing value. But here's the truth most marketers miss: tactics don't matter if you're targeting the wrong people.
            </p>

            <p class="font-sans text-lg text-slate-700 leading-loose mb-8">
                The goal of marketing is simple: <strong>more people should know about you today than yesterday.</strong> But not just anyone—the right people. The prospects who match your Ideal Customer Profile and are ready to buy. This is where most SaaS marketing fails.

                    <dt class="font-bold text-slate-900 text-lg">What is SaaS marketing?</dt>
                    <dd class="text-slate-600 mt-2 leading-relaxed text-lg">SaaS Marketing is the strategic process of attracting, converting, and retaining customers for a software-as-a-service product. Unlike traditional marketing, SaaS marketing must account for recurring revenue models, longer sales cycles, and the need to prove ongoing value. The goal is simple: more people should know about you today than yesterday.</dd>

                <div>
                    <dt class="font-bold text-slate-900 text-lg">How is SaaS marketing different from traditional marketing?</dt>
                    <dd class="text-slate-600 mt-2 leading-relaxed text-lg">SaaS marketing differs in four key ways: (1) Recurring revenue model requires ongoing customer success, not just acquisition; (2) Longer sales cycles with multiple decision-makers require trust-building content; (3) Higher contract values justify dedicated sales and marketing investment; (4) Best channels are LinkedIn, webinars, and outbound—not consumer platforms.</dd>

                    <dt class="font-bold text-slate-900 text-lg">What are the best SaaS marketing channels?</dt>
                    <dd class="text-slate-600 mt-2 leading-relaxed text-lg">The three best SaaS marketing channels are: (1) <strong>LinkedIn</strong>—business buyers are there and it still has organic reach; (2) <strong>Webinars & Events</strong>—builds trust and demonstrates expertise; (3) <strong>Outbound</strong>—email, calling, and direct mail with no pay-per-click costs. These channels compound when used together.</dd>

                    <dd class="text-slate-600 mt-2 leading-relaxed text-lg">Follow the 6-step framework: (1) Define your <a href="/" class="text-red-600 hover:underline">ICP</a>; (2) Identify the Macro Trend creating urgency; (3) Establish Positioning—SMB vs Enterprise; (4) Map Competition to prove 10x differentiation; (5) Create your Manifesto; (6) Execute your Broadway Show across LinkedIn, webinars, and outbound.</dd>

It defines which companies to target, what messaging will resonate, and which channels to prioritize.

                    <dd class="text-slate-600 mt-2 leading-relaxed text-lg">A marketing manifesto is your strategic narrative—"the thing about the thing." It's not a product pitch but your unique point of view about the problem you solve. Your manifesto educates the market on why the old way doesn't work and positions you as the thought leader. It powers all your LinkedIn content, webinar topics, and outbound messaging.</dd>
